Assignment 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains three files; mainprogram.cpp, parser.cpp, and parse.h, and they work in Atom
and Clion using c++11.

NOTE: Run Docker first, then use terminal and attach compsci. The three files need to be run
together on GCC command line.
Once ran, you will get an output to the screen, and you will also get an output.txt file with
the parsed information.

Resources: C++ Primer plus Sixth Edition, Zybooks, past C++ projects, past C++ class assignments.
